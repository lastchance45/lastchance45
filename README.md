- 👋 Hi, I’m @lastchance45
- 👀 I’m interested in learning and growing. I learned to code years ago and now I am just relearning how to do it again.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, Python, HTML5, Javascript and CSS
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that could use someone willing to help but without a ton of knowledge.
- 📫 How to reach me: you can find me through LinkedIN here or by email at shad_taylor219@ymail.com
